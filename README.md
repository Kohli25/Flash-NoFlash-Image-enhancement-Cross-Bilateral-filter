#Flash-NoFlash-Image-enhancement-Cross-Bilateral-filter

Algorithm takes two images:
  1. No Flash Image
  2. With Flash Image

Applying Cross/Joint Bileteral Filtering technique to enhance the image. Flash image is a good estimator of high frequency content in the image. While 

#How to USE
1.Unzip provided test cases image pairs to impliment the code
2.Edit the code:
  i. Un-Comment the commented code down in the code.
  ii. Add path to both images
  iii. Run the code and get the Enhanced image as output.
